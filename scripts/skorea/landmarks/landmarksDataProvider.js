    name: "Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces",
    details: "Constructed first among the Joseon palaces, Gyeongbokgung Palace was the representative legal palace of the Joseon dynasty. The original palace, completed in 1395, was destroyed by fire during the Imjin War (1592-1598), and remained in a state of disrepair for approximately 270 years. It wasn’t until the end of the Joseon Era in 1867 that it was reconstructed to show the grand majesty of the royal family. Changdeokgung Palace, west of Gyeongbokgung Palace, was built in 1405 as a secondary palace for King Taejong, the third king of the Joseon dynasty. Changdeokgung Palace’s most outstanding charm by far is the use of nature throughout the palace.",
